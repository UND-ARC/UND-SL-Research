# Questions for ??

* Req. 4.4 vs req. 3.11 -- if we use a UAV or jettison payload, does it have to touch down before
  the 90sec requirement is met or can we descent to a desired altitude?
* Does the 90sec requirement apply to every descending part or only the launch vehicle?
* Can we drop a "descent battery" from a flying UAV once it's depleted?
  - If so, does it need its own GPS/transponder system?
  - Can we drop a battery while stationary on the surface?  If so, does it need a tracking device?
* Live-tether cut for UAS -- does it have to be physically tethered, or can we just not deploy until ready?
